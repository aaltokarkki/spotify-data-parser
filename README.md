# spotify-data-parser

I made this here code to parse the data provided by Spotify when you ask for your listening data at https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/

The code has virtually no error handling but it should work if you input paths properly.

Packages required: orjson, openpyxl, datetime and matplotlib.
